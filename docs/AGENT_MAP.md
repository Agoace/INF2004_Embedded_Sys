# Agent Navigation Map — INF2004 Embedded Systems

Use this map before editing an unfamiliar part of the repository.

## Map chain

| Scope | Map or rule |
| --- | --- |
| Current repository | This file: `docs/AGENT_MAP.md` |
| Parent workspace | [School Repos map](../../../docs/AGENT_MAP.md) |

The parent-workspace link resolves only when this repository is checked out as a School Repos submodule. It does not resolve in a standalone clone.

## Repository boundaries

| Boundary | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Current repository | This independent Git repository owns all files below its root. It has no nested repositories or submodules. |
| Parent superproject checkout | The School Repos superproject tracks this repository as a gitlink. Commit and push here first; then update the gitlink in the parent repository. |
